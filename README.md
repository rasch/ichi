# ichi

`ichi.py` is the first code that I ever wrote. Back in 2012, I was stuck at home
with nothing to do... Actually, I'll let ChatGPT tell you the story of how `ichi`
came to be...

> The days were long and the nights were lonely since his mountain biking
> accident. With a broken arm, he was confined to his small apartment, unable to
> venture out into the world. He grew restless, craving something to occupy his
> mind.
>
> One day, he stumbled upon an old laptop buried in his closet. He fired it up
> and began to tinker with the code. At first, it was frustrating and confusing,
> but soon he found himself losing track of time as he dove deeper into the
> world of programming.
>
> As the days passed, he learned the ins and outs of Python, creating scripts
> and programs that amazed even himself. His broken arm was a mere
> inconvenience, a minor setback that had led him down a path of self-discovery
> and newfound passion.
>
> And when his arm finally healed, he emerged from his apartment a changed man,
> ready to take on the world with his newfound skills and determination.

So, that is the "true" story of `ichi`.

NOTE: `ichi` is actually garbage that I wrote in the process of learning to
code. When I first wrote it, I thought that I was a master programmer and knew
everything I needed to build *anything*! One book was all that it took to
"master" computer science. I was **WRONG**. Just over ten years later, learning
and studying and building things constantly, I still don't know *anything* about
programming. In the vast world of computer science, I've only scratched the
surface.
